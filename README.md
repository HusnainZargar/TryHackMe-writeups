# üß† TryHackMe Room Helper Scripts

Welcome to the **TryHackMe Room Helper Scripts** repository!  
This is a curated collection of custom scripts I've written or modified to help solve specific challenges across various rooms on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).

## üìÅ Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific TryHackMe room, and inside you'll find scripts relevant to that room. Most scripts are written in **Python**, **Bash**, or **PowerShell**, depending on the task.
